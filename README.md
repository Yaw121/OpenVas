### OBJECTIVE

Gain hands-on experience installing, configuring, and running OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Management) to perform automated vulnerability scanning within a controlled environment on TryHackMe. The goal was to understand how to set up a comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool and interpret scan results to strengthen an organizationâ€™s security posture.

### Skills Learned

<b>OpenVAS Installation & Configuration</b>: Learned how to install and configure the Greenbone Vulnerability Management platform from scratch, including database setup and web UI configuration.

<b>Vulnerability Scanning</b>: Explored how to schedule scans, generate reports, and interpret findings to identify critical vulnerabilities in a target environment.

<b>Network Services & Protocols</b>: Gained a deeper understanding of network services, ports, and protocols commonly found in enterprise environments.

<b>Troubleshooting & System Administration</b>: Enhanced troubleshooting techniques and command-line proficiency by dealing with environment-specific setup issues (firewall rules, dependencies, and resource configuration).

<b>Security Best Practices</b>: Reinforced the importance of regular vulnerability assessments and patch management in securing systems and networks.


### Tools Used

- <b>OpenVAS/Greenbone Vulnerability Manager</b>: Main vulnerability scanning and management platform.

- <b>Ubuntu</b>: Operating systems used for installing OpenVAS and performing scans.

- <b>SSH & Command-Line Tools</b>: Facilitated remote administration, file transfers, and system configuration.

- <b>Web Browser (OpenVAS Web Interface)</b>: Used for managing tasks, scheduling scans, and generating reports.

- <b>TryHackMe Platform</b>: Provided the hands-on environment for practical exercises and deployments.

Now that we have created our task and target, we can begin scanning our ports and network.  To start the task navigate to the start icon under Actions.

After the basic host and task information OpenVAS will report on each of the vulnerabilities found. In the screenshot below, the vulnerability breakdown can give a lot of information. We can gather a summary of the vulnerability, detection details, mitigation details, and method of detection.
